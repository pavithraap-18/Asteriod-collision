# Asteriod-collision
Asteroid Collision is a simulation problem where asteroids are represented by integers in a one-dimensional array â€” positive values move to the right and negative values move to the left. When two asteroids moving in opposite directions collide, the smaller one (by absolute value) explodes, and if they are of equal size, both are destroyed. Asteroids moving in the same direction never collide. To efficiently simulate this behavior, a stack is used to keep track of right-moving asteroids. When a left-moving asteroid appears, it is compared with the top of the stack to resolve collisions according to the rules. The process continues until all collisions are resolved, and the final state of the asteroid field is returned. This approach ensures an optimal linear time complexity, making it both effective and efficient for large inputs.
